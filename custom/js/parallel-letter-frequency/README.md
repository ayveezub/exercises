## Parallel Letter Frequency

### Instructions:

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done sequentially. A common example is counting the frequency of letters. Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a list of texts and that employs parallelism.

### Hint:

Use the `Promise.all()` method along with `async/await`.

### Run tests:

`npm run test`
